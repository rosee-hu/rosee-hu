# Hi, I'm Rose Hummusani

I'm a passionate software developer and machine learning enthusiast based in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and I love building projects that solve real-world problems — whether it’s through web apps, mobile apps, or AI-powered systems.

I’m skilled in a wide range of technologies including:

- **Web & Mobile Wizardry:** Mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a flair for React, Next.js, Node.js, Flutter, Dart, and PHP to build responsive and sleek apps that users love.

- **Code & Data Cruncher:** Skilled in Python, Java, and C++, blending programming power with Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and data mining to unlock insights and automate smart solutions.

- **Database & Backend Builder:** Experienced with SQL, MySQL, and Firebase, creating robust and scalable data storage and retrieval systems.

- **Design & Dev Tools:** Proficient with Git for version control, Odoo ERP for business management, and UI/UX design tools like Figma, Axure, and Balsamiq to bring ideas to life with clean, user-friendly interfaces.

I enjoy working on projects involving cybersecurity, computer vision, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and productivity apps. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to exciting open-source initiatives.
